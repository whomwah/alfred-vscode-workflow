# Open in VSCode workflow

Searches for `.git` repos in the path of your choice and allows you to either
open them in VSCode or in the terminal. It's really fast though.

### Prerequisites

- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (obviously!)
- [`findd`](https://github.com/whomwah/findd) - A tiny little utility that does
  the magic of finding all the repos really really fast.

You can install `VSCode` by downloading it from above. The easiest way to
install `findd` is via `homebrew`:

`brew install whomwah/tap/findd`
